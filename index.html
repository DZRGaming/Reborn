                    <hr>
                    <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into
                        a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
                        his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
                        able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared
                        with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? "
                        he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully
                        between its four familiar walls.</p>

                    <p>A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above
                        it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
                        gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy
                        fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out
                        the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel
                        quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but
                        that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present
                        state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled
                        back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have
                        to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that
                        he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen!
